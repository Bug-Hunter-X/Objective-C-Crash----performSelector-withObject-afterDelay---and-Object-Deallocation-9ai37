The solution uses Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) and blocks to avoid the problem of `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` retaining the object after it's been deallocated.

```objectivec
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)myMethod {
    dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(2.0 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ 
        NSLog(@"My string: %@
", self.myString);
    });
}
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyClass deallocated");
}
@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
        obj.myString = [NSString stringWithString:@"Hello"];
        [obj myMethod];
        obj = nil; //Release the object
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This revised code uses a block and `dispatch_after`. The block retains `self` only for the duration of its execution, eliminating the risk of accessing deallocated memory.  This approach is generally safer and more predictable for handling delayed operations in Objective-C.
