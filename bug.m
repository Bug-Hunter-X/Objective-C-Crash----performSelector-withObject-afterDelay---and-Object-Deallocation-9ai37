This code snippet demonstrates a potential issue in Objective-C related to the use of `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` and retaining objects.

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)myMethod {
    [self performSelector:@selector(delayedMethod) withObject:nil afterDelay:2.0];
}

- (void)delayedMethod {
    NSLog(@"My string: %@
", self.myString);
}

- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyClass deallocated");
}
@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
        obj.myString = [NSString stringWithString:@"Hello"];
        [obj myMethod];
        obj = nil; //Release the object
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The problem lies in the fact that even after `obj` is set to `nil`, the `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` method still retains a reference to the `MyClass` instance.  After the 2 second delay, `delayedMethod` is called. If `myString` is released before this call, a crash can occur due to accessing deallocated memory. This is because `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` retains the object during the delay and doesn't release it immediately, even if the original reference is released.
